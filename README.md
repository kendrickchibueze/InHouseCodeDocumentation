# In-House Code Documentation for Bank🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️👌😎😃

In this project,I created an in-house code-documentation tool for a
 Mini Bank group of developers such that Classes, Methods,Properties, Enums etc. are annotated with a Document Attribute. This is a documented code so that each developer in the team can easily understand each steps taken and can in turn contribute to the repository. The Document Attribute takes one required parameter *"Description" and two optional Parameters "Input" and "Output"*
respectively. When **GetDocs()** is called it displays details of all codes documented throughout the assembly. We created a class library namespace and used it to define  our **DocumentAttribute** which is being referenced in the  executable project folder.

The screenshot of the sample display of our output code shows the following:
